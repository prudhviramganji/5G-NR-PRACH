The fifth generation of mobile communication (5G) relies on the random access (RA) procedure, similar to previous mobile communication systems, to enable uplink synchronization 
between user equipment (UE) and the next generation Node B (gNB). The RA procedure achieves this synchronization by detecting preambles in the Physical Random Access Channel
(PRACH). This paper proposes a novel method for detecting preambles in the PRACH at the 5G base station (gNB). 
Our proposed method employs an enhanced algorithm with multiple detection steps to effectively reject false alarm peaks caused by noise and channel conditions, such as
multipath fading, Doppler shift, frequency offset, and timing offset. Simulation results demonstrate that our proposed method, with optimized detection thresholds, meets 
the systemâ€™s requirements for detection probability and false alarm probability under a specific signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) level and propagation condition.
